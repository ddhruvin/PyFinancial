# Stock-data-finding-Python-Package-
Data Retrieval upon a method passing. Thats what packages are about. Also it fosters Code-Reproducability

# 1. Introduction: 
In this project, we aimed to analyze financial time series data for detecting anomalies using Python. We utilized 
historical daily stock data from Alpha Vantage API and implemented anomaly detection techniques to identify 
significant deviations in price changes, volume surges, and price gaps.
Also it returns a Description of the Stock along with the Income Statements over the past few years.
 
# 2. Data Retrieval: 
We used the Alpha Vantage API to fetch historical daily stock data for a given ticker symbol. The `findanomaly` 
function was developed to construct the API query and retrieve the data. This function also incorporated error 
handling to manage API request failures.
